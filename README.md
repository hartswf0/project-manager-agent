## 3. Technology Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: OpenAI API
- Additional (if needed):
  - Server: Node.js hosted on Glitch (for voice/image processing)
  - Alternative: Gradio and Python (for deeper system instruction engineering)

## 4. Timeline
- Week 1: Brainstorming, Architecture Planning, and Prototyping
- Weeks 2-4: Development
- Week 5: Testing and Refinement

## 5. Key Considerations
- Regular team meetings to address dependencies and blockers
- Use of version control (e.g., Git) for collaboration
- Implementation of console logging for debugging
- Focus on creating a unique chatbot personality
- Prioritization of user experience in all development decisions

## 6. Next Steps
1. Schedule a kick-off meeting with the entire team
2. Begin the brainstorming phase
3. Set up the development environment and project repository
